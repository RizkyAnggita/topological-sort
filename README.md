# Topological Sort
Python program for Topological Sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
<br></br>

# Decrease and Conquer Algorithm
For every node in graph, find node with 0 In-Degree. <br>
Then, remove those nodes and edges of those nodes from the graph (Decrease) <br>
Then do topological sort for the remaining graph and so on.<br>



## Requirements
    ```
    Python 3
    ```
# How to Use
Make sure that you have Python3 on your local computer <br>
Clone this repository into your local computer <br>
Run 13519132.py inside ./src <br>
Input your file name, example : 1.txt. The file has to be inside ./test/  <br>
The program will show the result of topological sort <br>
